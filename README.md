In this repo, I will put the code that I worked on during my learning at the freeCodeCamp courses!

# Python Course
## caesar.py: Caesar Encryption Application  
This mini project is used to encrypt plaintext or decrypt encrypted_text 
The user can input the text that they wanna encrypt or decrypt, and also specify the shift amount.

## RPG_char_builder: An RPG Character Builder
A small program that creates an RPG character after validating the character name and three stats (Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma). The function must ensure the name follows specific rules (type, length, no spaces, etc.), the stats are valid integers within the range, and their total equals 7. If everything is valid, it returns a formatted character sheet displaying the character name and stat bars using full and empty dots.

## pin_extractor.py: A pin extractor from poems
Given a poem or more, this mini project is used to extract the hidden pins in the input poems, where the nth digit of the pin is hidden as the length of the nth word in the nth line, e.g., the first digit of the pin is hidden as the length of the first word in the first line.
