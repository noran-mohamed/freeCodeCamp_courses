In this repo, I will put the code that I worked on during my learning at the freeCodeCamp courses!

# Python Course
## First: Caesar Encryption Application  
This mini project is used to encrypt plaintext or decrypt encrypted_text 
The user can input the text that they wanna encrypt or decrypt, and also specify the shift amount.

## Second: An RPG Character Builder
A small program that creates an RPG character after validating the character name and three stats (Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma). The function must ensure the name follows specific rules (type, length, no spaces, etc.), the stats are valid integers within range, and their total equals 7. If everything is valid, it returns a formatted character sheet displaying the character name and stat bars using full and empty dots.
