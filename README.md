In this repo, I will put the code that I worked on during my learning at the freeCodeCamp courses!

# Python Course
## caesar.py -> Caesar Encryption Application  
This mini project is used to encrypt plaintext or decrypt encrypted_text 
The user can input the text that they wanna encrypt or decrypt, and also specify the shift amount.

## RPG_char_builder.py -> An RPG Character Builder
A small program that creates an RPG character after validating the character name and three stats (Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma). The function must ensure the name follows specific rules (type, length, no spaces, etc.), the stats are valid integers within the range, and their total equals 7. If everything is valid, it returns a formatted character sheet displaying the character name and stat bars using full and empty dots.

## pin_extractor.py -> A Pin Extractor from Poems
Given a poem or more, this mini project is used to extract the hidden pins in the input poems, where the nth digit of the pin is hidden as the length of the nth word in the nth line, e.g., the first digit of the pin is hidden as the length of the first word in the first line.

## medical_data_validator.py -> A Medical Data Validator
A small program that validates a list of medical records to ensure they follow a consistent format. Each record is checked to confirm it is a dictionary containing the required fields (patient ID, age, gender, diagnosis, medications, and last visit ID). If any record or field is invalid, the program reports detailed error messages indicating the unexpected format and the position of the faulty record; otherwise, it confirms that all records are valid.

## build_a_user_configuration_manager.py -> A User Configuration Manager
This program allows users to manage their settings such as theme, language, and notifications. I implemented functions to add, update, delete, and view user settings.

## ISBN_validator.py -> AN ISBN validator
The ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is a unique identifier assigned to commercial books. It can be either 10 or 13 digits long, and the last digit is a check digit calculated from the other digits. When the user runs the program, it will show the prompt **Enter ISBN and length:** The user can enter the ISBN code they want to validate in **ISBN,length** format. The ISBN code should not contain hyphens, followed by its length (10 or 13), separated by a comma.

Example inputs: 1530051126,10 for ISBN-10 codes. 9781530051120,13 for ISBN-13 codes.

## planet_class.py -> A Planet Class
This Python exercise defines a Planet class that represents a planet and its basic properties, along with simple validation to ensure all attributes are valid.  It provides methods to display planet information and simulate orbital behavior.

## email_simulator.py -> An Email Simulator 
This mini program simulates sending, receiving, and managing emails between different users, by implementing classes, objects, and how to organize code in an object-oriented way.

## budget_app.py -> A Budget App 
This simple budget app tracks spending in different categories and can show the relative spending percentage on a graph.

## salary_tracker.py -> A Salary Tracker System
A salary tracking system for employees.

## game_char_stats_tracker.py -> A Game Character Stats Tracker
A game character stats tracker. The program will allow you to create a character with specific attributes, update those attributes, and retrieve the current stats of the character.
